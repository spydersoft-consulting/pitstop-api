| `MpgThisFillUp`        | decimal?       | Computed — see below               |

### FuelGrade

| Value      | Description  |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| `Regular`  | 87 octane    |
| `MidGrade` | 89 octane    |
| `Premium`  | 91/93 octane |
| `Diesel`   |              |
| `E85`      |              |

## Computed Fields

Computed fields are recalculated by `FillUpService.RecalculateComputedFieldsAsync` after every create, update, or delete operation on a vehicle's fill-ups. They are stored in the database, not derived at query time.

| Field                  | Formula                               | Null when                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `MilesSinceLastFillUp` | `currentOdometer - previousOdometer`  | First fill-up for the vehicle            |
| `MpgThisFillUp`        | `MilesSinceLastFillUp / GallonsAdded` | First fill-up, or `IsFullFillUp = false` |
| `CostPerMile`          | `TotalCost / MilesSinceLastFillUp`    | Computed at query time, not stored       |

Fill-ups are ordered by `OdometerReading` (not insertion order) for calculation.

## Database

- **Engine:** PostgreSQL via `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`
- **Migrations:** Applied automatically on API startup via `Database.MigrateAsync()`
- **Indexes:** `(VehicleId, FilledAt)`, `(VehicleId, OdometerReading)`, `OwnerId`

## Historical Data

The initial dataset was imported from a Google Sheets spreadsheet ("Bronco Gas.gsheet") covering October 2025 – April 2026. Costs were matched against Quicken credit card exports using the `match-fillups.ps1` script in `D:\spydersoft\plans\pitstop`. 16 records were imported, all matched to transactions.

Vehicle: 2022 Ford Bronco Outer Banks — `InitialOdometer = 0`, `TankCapacityGallons = 20.8`, `StartDate = 2025-10-25`.
